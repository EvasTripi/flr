Welcome to flr
================

Welcome to flr's documentation. flr is a system for creating BREAD (browse-read-edit-add-delete) web apps.
You can read the :doc:`introduction` for a general description about the project.
See :doc:`getting_started` for installation instructions
and to get the example app running. Then in :doc:`creating_app` you can find
a tutorial for creating a new app. The last part :doc:`reference` contains
a description of all components of flr in detail (work in progress).

Flask depends on the `Flask`_ framework and the `Peewee`_ ORM
The documentation for these libraries can be found at:

- `Flask documentation <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/>`_
- `Peewee documentation <https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/>`_
