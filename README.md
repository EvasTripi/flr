[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/julianss/flr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/julianss/flr)


Framework for creating BREAD (browse-read-edit-add-delete) web applications. Basically, it's a fully functioning generic app where you just define the business logic and the layout of the views and menus, and put your colors and logos. 

Uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/). Frontend built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It was inspired by [Odoo](https://odoo.com). Requires Python 3.6+ and Postgresql.
